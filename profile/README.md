# QualiTravel org intro

This GitHub organization represent all the software, APIs and technical documents associated with QualiTravel - a IATA certified travel agency based in Slovakia.

This document will be extended in the future and provide public facing documentation and guidance for API connection with B2B partners.

I also want to share my personal experience developing software for the travel industry, especially NDC implementation and mid/back-office software for travel agencies. Hopefully, much of this will be open-sourced for others who deal with similar problems.
